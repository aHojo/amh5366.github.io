            <p>Hey! I'm Andrew! One of the most difficult decisions in my life was deciding to leave a comfortable, somewhat
                stable job to pursue a dream, not knowing if I was going to succeed or fail. That's never stopped me during
                my life though! If someone tells me I can not do something, I'm most certainly going to try, and bring with
                me all of the tenacity I have. This trait of mine has helped me tremendously. While in college to recieve
                my B.S. in Kinesiology, a teacher once told me that I'd never make it as a trainer, or have a career in sports
                medicine, because I was too shy. Which was the truth, I am introverted, and at the time, wasn't very fond
                of social interaction. That same week I applied and was accepted as a trainer for The Pennsylvania State
                University. It was uncomfortable for me, however, I was able to rid myself of that introverted side through
                sheer will.
            </p>
            <p>In a sense, that teacher was right. Even though I studied hard and recieved my CSCS (Certified Strength and Conditioning
                Specialist), I wouldn't make it as a Kinesiologist. The reason was, my heart was in Computer Science, developing
                and working with and on computers. I was lucky enough to start out as an intern as a Linux Administrator,
                where I worked and studied hard enough to recieve a job offer at the end of the internship. I currenlty love
                my job as a Linux Systems Administrator. I still work hard to study, and keep up/be on par with my fellow
                team, but the transition was worth it! I want to extend my knowledge to those around me and help them in
                any way I can with computer science. The trainer in me will never leave, and I will always want to help people.
            </p>
            <p>In my free time (who has that anymore?!) I like to play games, and work gaining more knowledge in the development
                and systems administration department. I'm still very active, exercising 6 days a week. I believe this is
                one of the better habits that I have! I also try to talk to knew people everyday, because being social to
                me is a skill that without practice, can degrade. Working at a desk all day behind a screen doesn't provide
                a lot of in-person interaction after all!
            </p>
            <p>I have some lofty goals that I am working towards. Firstly, I want to work my way up to be a Senior Systems Administratror,
                and is my main motivation for studying hard. I also want to create. This is why I started to work on development
                in my spare time. I want to produce something that will be shared by thousands of people. The app I want
                to create still eludes me, but I have this end game of creating something magnificent. I also have a desire
                to improve the live of others, and help them through tough times. This leads me to my last two goals. I want
                to teach people, and give them the hope I had when switching careers. I want to teach the knowledge I've
                gained, I have given myself 10 years, but that could come sooner if I feel I've learned fast enough. I also
                want to stream, so I can influence people around the world! It's ambitious, but I believe I can do it!
